# 1 - Introduction to Cryptocurrency

-> Cryptocurrency: are a form of decentralized digital money/currency Cryptocurrencies don't have a central issuing or regulating authority, instead  they use a decentralized system to record transactions and issue new units.

-> Fiat Currency: is government-issued currency that is not backed by a commodity such as gold. The US Dollar, Canadian  Dollar, Euro and various other currencies are all examples of fiat currency.

-> Cryptocurrency:

* Any form of currency that exists digitally or virtually and uses cryptography to secure transactions;
* Don't have a central issuing or regulationg authority;
* Use a decentralized system to record transactions and issue new units;
* Many different types of cryptocurrencies. Some are simply currencies while others can be considered platforms.

-> White Papers:

* A document released by developers that explains the technology and purpose of the project;
* Should define the following characteristis/properties:
    * Why the project was created;
    * The projects real-world utility;
    * Consensus mechanism;
    * Initial coin distribution;
    * Technical explanation (math, cryptography, formulas);
    * Timeline (ICO, releases).

-> Fiat Currency:

* Government issued currency that is not backed by a commodity sych as gold;
* Fiat currency gives central banks greater control over the economy because they can control circulation;
* Fiat money is backed only by the faith of the controlling government;
* Corrupt governments or poor monetary policy can cause hyperinflation and devalue currencies.


# 2 - Ethereum Basics

-> Turing Complete: it refers to a machine (or programming language) that, given enough time and memory along with the necessary instructions, can solve any computational problem, mo matter how complex. Most modern programming languares (including Solidity) are turing complete.

-> Solidity: is the official language for Ethereum. It is used to write smart contracts for Ethereum and various other blockchain networks.

-> Bitcoin:

* A limited system that is only used to decentralize finance;
* The original cryptocurrency. Thought as a form of digital gold;
* Turing incomplete;
* Only capable of understanding a limited instructions set.

-> Introduction To Turing Completeness:

* All modern programming languages are Turing complete (Python, C++, JavaScript);
* To be Turing complete a language needs to be able to do anything a Turing machine can do;
* A TUring machine is an endlessly long piece of tape that has a read/write head. It can read/write 0's and 1's in the cell on the tape. This allows anything to be computed;
* Alan Turing invented computer science and the idea of the computer.

-> Turing Machine Requirements:

* Must be able to perform conditional branching:
    * Jump/Go To Block;
    * If, Then, Else.
* Can express any possible program:
    * Loops and/or recursion;
    * Repeat until (while loops);
    * May contain infinite loops.
* You cannot predict or prove the final state of a Turing complete language;
* Bitcoin is Turing incomplete. This means the final state of any program can be proven before running it.

-> Introduction to Ethereum:

* Turing complete;
* Does not only provide decentralized finance. It is considered a decentralized development platform;
* Allows development and usage of decentralized apps with the use of the native Ether token;
* Has a programming language called Solidity that allows you to write code (smart contracts) that are hosted on the blockchain;
* Smart contracts allow for programs/applications that implement voting, games, exchanges, auctions and much more to be decentralized;
* Ethereum's goal is to decentralize the internet. Not just finance.

-> Differences of Ethereum and Bitcoin:

Ethereum is different that Bitcoin as it provides a development platform that anybody can use to write decentralized applications, Bitcoin is simply used for decentralized finance while Ethereum aims to decentralize all aspects of the internet. With Ethereum users can create self-executing smart contracts that run in a turing complete environment.

While Ethereum may sometimes be faster than Bitcoin it's speed is not guaranteed and speed is not a major differentiator between the cryptocurrencies.


# 3 - Smart Contracts and DApps

-> DApp: stands for "Decentralized Application" and is an application that runs on a blockchain and utilizes the blockchain as it's single source of truth.

-> Smart Contract: is a simply code that is stored on the blockchain that runs when certain conditions are met. Smart contracts are utilized to implement purchase/sale agreements, currency exchanges, ERC-20 and ERC-721 tokens and various other decentralized applications.

-> Smart Contracts:

* Programs that are stored on the blockchain and run when predetermined conditions are met;
* Used to automate the execution of an agreement so that all participants are immediately certain of the outcome;
* Smart contracts have the following properties:
    * Immutable;
    * Transparent/Public;
    * Executed by nodes on the network;
    * Cost money (crypto) to deploy;
    * Can hold a balance, just like a regular address.

 -> Smart Contracts Continued:

* Only run when called upon and provided gas;
* All operations are traceable and irreversible;
* Anyone can deploy a smart contract but inde they are deployed they cannot be changed or deleted;
* Cannot make HTTP requests or rely on any data outside of the blockchain;
* DApps or Decentralized Apps are made up of one or multiple smart contracts.

-> DApp Examples:

* Auctions;
* Games;
* Sale of Assets;
* Decentralized Exchanges;
* Web Browsers;
* Credit Services.

-> Example of a Smart Contract:

Lets make up the situation that i want to sell a house, so i create a smart contract of 100 ETH for the house. The smart contract will be saved in a block inside of the Ethereum network. To be deploy it is needed to pay a deploy fee. Lets say someone want to buy the house it will send a transaction of 100 ETH and the deed of the house would go to the person that bought.
