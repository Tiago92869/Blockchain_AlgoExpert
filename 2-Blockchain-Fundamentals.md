# 1 - Introduction to Blockchain and Web3

Differences between Web 1.0, Web 2.0, Web 3.0

->Web 1.0 (1991 to 2004):

* Mostly Static pages;
* Referred to as the read-only web;
* Running advertisements was banned;
* Mostly used for information and research;
* Frames and tables were used to position and align elements.


-> Web 2.0 (2005 to current era):

* Web 2.0 refers to worldwide websites which highlight user-generated content;
* Interactions, social media, communities, GUI's;
* Lage focus on UI/UX design; 
* Brought the popularity of AJAX and JavaScript for dynamic websites;
* Community focused;
* User adta owned and controlled by intermediaries (Google, Facebook, Amazon).


-> Web 3.0 (the future of internet)

* Large focus on backend systems, databases and ledgers;
* Data ins't owned by a single party. It is shared;
* Portable and personal;
* Immersion over interaction;
* Blockchain and decentralization;
* Artificial inteligence.

Difference between Web2 and Web3 is that the data is owned by the site 
in web3 there is no owner to the data, data is shared between the people.

-> Introduction To Blockchain

A blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat.
A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is the duplicated and distributed acress the enire netweork of computer systems on the blockchain.
A blockchain is not owned by a central entity.

# 2 - Centralized vs Decentralized

->Centralized Systems:

* Most systems we use today are centralized (goolge, amazon...);
* Systens controlled by a single entity.


->Decentralization Systems:

Is the process by which the activities of an organization particularly those regarding planning and decision making, are distributed  or delegated away from a central, authoritative location or group.

Decentralized systems allow for trust-less interactions


->Advantages and Disadvantages:

|  Centralized  Systems  |  Decentralized Systems  |
|:-----------------------|------------------------:|
|  Low network diameter, allowing fast flow of data  |  Large network diameter (participants may be many edges away from each other), meaning data may flow slower  |
|  Simple to implement and usually highly performant  |  Difficult to implement with lower throughput, causing lower performance  |
|  Data conflicts are easily solved and synchronization is easy and clear  |  A complex protocol is needed to dispute data conflicts and find a resolution. Synchronization is difficult  |
|  Single point of failure. Easy to take down or offline  |  No single point of failure. Network can still function if a large portion of participants are taken down or offline  |
|  A central authority can sensor/change or delete data  |  Censorship is much harder and its almost impossible to change or delete existing data  |
|  Participation is regulated by central authority  |  Anyone can participate in the network; there are no "gatekeepers"  |


# 3 - Ledgers

A ledger is simply a collection or store of financial accounts or information. A blockchain is said to be decentralized, distributed ledger of verifiable transactions.

For example, we have a ledger between Bob and ALice, the ledger records all the financial transactions between the two, but anyone of them can just edit the ledger if they wanted and add fake transactions. To fix that we can add a intermediate between they and the ledger. For example a bank, Bob and Alice trade with the money they have in the bank, and the bank keeps track on the transactions writing in the ledger. But at  the same time, the someone in the bank can create false transactions in the ledger, so the ledger  ins't 100% secured. To fix this problem we introduced blockchain.

Just to verify, a blockchain is a distributed, decentralized, publicly available ledger of transactions that are verified.

THere are some properties that allowed us to trust  in blockhain:

* Immutable: unchanging over  time or unable to get changed;
* Publicly Available: available to anyone in the general public;
* Decentralized: controlled by several local offices or authorities rather than one single one;
* Distributed: shared or spread out;
* Chronological: starting with the earliest and following the order in which they occured;
* Irrevocable: not able to be changed, reversed, or recovered.
